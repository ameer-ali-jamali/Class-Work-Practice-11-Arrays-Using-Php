Arrays
An array is a collection of data items of the same data type. And it is also known as a subscript variable.

Example:

<?php
$age = array("Virat" => "35", "Arshdeep" => "37", "Rohit" => "43");
echo "Virat is " . $age['Virat'] . " years old.";
?>


There are three different kinds of arrays.

1. Numeric Array
These are arrays with a numeric index where values are stored and accessed in a linear fashion.

Example:

<?php
$bike = array("TVS", "YAMAHA", "RAJDOOT");
echo "I like " . $bike[0] . ", " . $bike[1] . " and " . $bike[2] . ".";
?>


2. Associative Array
These are arrays with string as an index where it stores element values associated with key values.

Example:

<?php
$age = array("Ben" => "35", "Stokes" => "37", "Jimi" => "43");
echo "Ben is " . $age['Ben'] . " years old.";
?>


3. Multidimensional Arrays
A multidimensional Array is an array containing one or more arrays where values are accessed using multiple indices.

Example:

<?php
$cars = array(
  array("Volvo", 22, 18),
  array("BMW", 15, 13),
  array("Saab", 5, 2),
  array("Land Rover", 17, 15)
);
echo $cars[0][0] . ": In stock: " . $cars[0][1] . ", sold: " . $cars[0][2] . ".<br>";
?>
